##Module 1. Architecture: Principle of software development

**Task**: Create modular project with using DRY principle. You could use any of build managers (ant, maven, gradle and etc.)

##Module 2. Backend: Memory Management and Garbage Collection

**Task 1**: Take your application and reduce typical -Xmx in 2x. Try different GC algorithms described in presentation. Compare the results with the GC log output. Run it on Java 7 and 8. After that tune Heap and PermGen (or play with Metaspace) and try to utilize and uberize free memory.
Try to reach next goals if possible:
- High throughput in a single processor environment
- High throughput in a multi-processor environment
- High throughput and latency below one second in a multi-processor environment
- Lowest possible latency in a multi-processor environment

**Task 2**: Write your own StatelessClassLoader which will load only stateless classes (without fields) from .jar file specified as input parameter (). Donâ€™t forget provide test code.
